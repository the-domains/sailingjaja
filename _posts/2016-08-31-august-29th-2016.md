# Replacing the cabin lights

August 29th, 2016

After months of trying to find lights that fit over the ginormous 10 gauge wires and fiberglass coming out of the ceiling I decided to just clean up the mess and move the lights slightly to get them to fit. Using a little cleaner and the magical cleaning pads below this junk came off perfectly. Now to get 3 more lights and the lighting will be finished.
